I was not able to reproduce this issue in Edge 38, 42, or 44.\r\nI'm reticent to turn off the sticky functionality for all Edge users because of one version (or perhaps an\r\ninteraction of that version with a specific graphics adapter or other setting). So instead, I'm leaving this\r\nas an example for anyone forced to support Edge 41 who may see the same issue. If that's the case, just\r\nadd this selector to your own CSS.\r\n\r\n@supports (-ms-ime-align: auto) {\r\n\t.cv-day {\r\n\t\tposition: relative;\r\n\t}\r\n}\r\n*/\r\n\r\n_:-ms-lang(x),\r\n.cv-day {\r\n\tposition: relative;\r\n}\r\n*/ .cv-day-number {\r\n\tposition: absolute;\r\n\tright: 0;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.cv-event {\r\n\tposition: absolute;\r\n\twhite-space: nowrap;\r\n\toverflow: hidden;\r\n\tbackground-color: #f7f7f7;\r\n\tborder-width: 1px;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* Wrap to show entire event title on hover */\r\n.cv-wrapper.wrap-event-title-on-hover .cv-event:hover {\r\n\twhite-space: normal;\r\n\tz-index: 1;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* Colors */\r\n\r\n.cv-header-days,\r\n.cv-header-day,\r\n.cv-weeks,\r\n.cv-week,\r\n.cv-day,\r\n.cv-event {\r\n\tborder-style: solid;\r\n\tborder-color: #ddd;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* Event Times */\r\n.cv-event .endTime::before {\r\n\tcontent: \"-\";\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* Internal Metrics */\r\n.cv-header-day,\r\n.cv-day-number,\r\n.cv-event {\r\n\tpadding: 0.2em;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* Allows emoji icons or labels (such as holidays) to be added more easily to specific dates by having the margin set already. */\r\n.cv-day-number::before {\r\n\tmargin-right: 0.5em;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.cv-event.offset0 {\r\n\tleft: 0;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.cv-event.offset1 {\r\n\tleft: calc((100% / 7));\r\n}\r\n\r\n.cv-event.offset2 {\r\n\tleft: calc((200% / 7));\r\n}\r\n\r\n.cv-event.offset3 {\r\n\tleft: calc((300% / 7));\r\n}\r\n\r\n.cv-event.offset4 {\r\n\tleft: calc((400% / 7));\r\n}\r\n\r\n.cv-event.offset5 {\r\n\tleft: calc((500% / 7));\r\n}\r\n\r\n.cv-event.offset6 {\r\n\tleft: calc((600% / 7));\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* Metrics for events spanning dates */\r\n\r\n.cv-event.span1 {\r\n\twidth: calc((100% / 7) - 0.05em);\r\n}\r\n\r\n.cv-event.span2 {\r\n\twidth: calc((200% / 7) - 0.05em);\r\n}\r\n\r\n.cv-event.span3 {\r\n\twidth: calc((300% / 7) - 0.05em);\r\n\ttext-align: center;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.cv-event.span4 {\r\n\twidth: calc((400% / 7) - 0.05em);\r\n\ttext-align: center;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.cv-event.span5 {\r\n\twidth: calc((500% / 7) - 0.05em);\r\n\ttext-align: center;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.cv-event.span6 {\r\n\twidth: calc((600% / 7) - 0.05em);\r\n\ttext-align: center;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.cv-event.span7 {\r\n\twidth: calc((700% / 7) - 0.05em);\r\n\ttext-align: center;\r\n}\r\n\r\n/* Hide scrollbars for the grid and the week */\r\n.cv-weeks::-webkit-scrollbar,\r\n.cv-week::-webkit-scrollbar {\r\n\twidth: 0; /* remove scrollbar space */\r\n\tbackground: transparent; /* optional: just make scrollbar invisible */\r\n}\r\n</style>\r\n","import mod from \"-!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./CalendarView.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./CalendarView.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"","import { render, staticRenderFns } from \"./CalendarView.vue?vue&type=template&id=68dafdc6&\"\nimport script from \"./CalendarView.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nexport * from \"./CalendarView.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nimport style0 from \"./CalendarView.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&lang=css&\"\n\n\n/* normalize component */\nimport normalizer from \"!../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/runtime/componentNormalizer.js\"\nvar component = normalizer(\n  script,\n  render,\n  staticRenderFns,\n  false,\n  null,\n  null,\n  null\n  \n)\n\nexport default component.exports","import './setPublicPath'\nexport * from '~entry'\n","module.exports = '\\x09\\x0A\\x0B\\x0C\\x0D\\x20\\xA0\\u1680\\u180E\\u2000\\u2001\\u2002\\u2003' +\n  '\\u2004\\u2005\\u2006\\u2007\\u2008\\u2009\\u200A\\u202F\\u205F\\u3000\\u2028\\u2029\\uFEFF';\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
